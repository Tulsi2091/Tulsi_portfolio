=== HOBBIES ===
Tulsi is definitely not just about code and coursework.

Outside of work, Tulsi loves to travel and explore new places — especially places that involve good food. Hiking is a big favorite, whether it’s scenic trails, national parks, or just exploring nature somewhere new. Traveling for Tulsi is less about ticking boxes and more about discovering local food, wandering around unfamiliar neighborhoods, and experiencing how different places feel.
She’s also someone who genuinely enjoys activities that involve problem-solving and a bit of fun pressure. Escape rooms, puzzles, board games, mini golf, and adventure courses are some of her favorites — anything that mixes teamwork, strategy, and a little competitiveness.
